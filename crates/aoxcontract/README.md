# aoxcontract

## Purpose

Contract-facing types and adapter surfaces for chain-integrated contract tooling.

## Production Intent

This crate is part of the AOXChain relay-oriented mainnet roadmap. Its interfaces are expected to evolve toward:

- deterministic behavior in consensus-critical paths,
- explicit and typed error surfaces,
- testable integration boundaries with other workspace crates,
- audit-friendly documentation and change control.

## Local Development

From repository root:

```bash
cargo check -p aoxcontract
```

## Integration Notes

- Keep API changes synchronized with dependent crates in the same pull request.
- For consensus/network/identity touching changes, include tests or deterministic command paths.
- Avoid introducing implicit defaults in critical runtime logic; prefer explicit parameters.
